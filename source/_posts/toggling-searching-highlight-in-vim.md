## Toggling Searching Highlight in Vim

Some people disable highlight searching in Vim because it is bother about toggling between `:hl`Â and `:nohl`. Even though you can create a shortcut for it, don't you want to do it automatically. Let's imagine that we can highlight all matching results when search. After we moving our cursor, the highlight off automatically.


The plugin of [vim-cool](https://github.com/romainl/vim-cool), is so cool just like its name, can help use make it come true!

**You should have a try!**
